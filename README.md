Community Learning Hub, is envisioned as a community platform where users can explore educational content, engage with a curated feed, and earn credit points for their participation.

Its core features include user authentication via JWT, a credit points system that rewards users for actions like watching content, engaging with the feed, and sharing, and a feed aggregator that pulls content from APIs like Twitter, Reddit, and LinkedIn, displaying content in a user-friendly format.

The platform also includes an admin/moderator panel for reviewing reports, managing content and users, and viewing platform statistics. The backend is built using an Express.js API with MongoDB, and is deployed on GCP, while the frontend is developed with React.js and Tailwind CSS, and is deployed on Firebase or GCP.
